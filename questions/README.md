    Answer -> Maybe he could increase the speed of elevators by using technicians.

## Is testing a waste of money? Why?

    Answer -> No, because it can help to detect and resolve problem upstream. This would waste more time(and money)if these problems were detected after the product is delivered to the customer.

## Set up a challenge for another candidate in order to test his/her abilities, explain your choice.

A few weeks ago, I solve a problem on Codingame. I found this little code challenging and funny.

The Goal :

Your program must allow Thor to reach the light of power.

Rules :

Thor moves on a map which is 40 wide by 18 high. Note that the coordinates (X and Y) start at the top left! This means the most top left cell has the coordinates "X=0,Y=0" and the most bottom right one has the coordinates "X=39,Y=17".

Once the program starts you are given:

the variable lightX: the X position of the light of power that Thor must reach.

the variable lightY: the Y position of the light of power that Thor must reach.

the variable initialTX: the starting X position of Thor.

the variable initialTY: the starting Y position of Thor.

 

At the end of the game turn, you must output the direction in which you want Thor to go among:


N (North)

NE (North-East)

E (East)

SE (South-East)

S (South)

SW (South-West)

W (West)

NW (North-West)

 

4 integers : lightX lightY initialTX initialTY.

(lightX, lightY) indicates the position of the light.

(initialTX, initialTY) indicates the initial position of Thor.
