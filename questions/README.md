# Questions
**Instructions:** Answer the questions, be concise.

## What is an Object?

    Answer -> In most programming languages, an object is usually a data type storing the "framework" of said object (set of function(s), parameter(s), method(s)), hence the object has its behaviour(s) and code. 

## [For Ruby developers] Can you explain the difference between include and extend in Ruby?

    Answer ->

## [For Python developers] Can you name 5 python librairies that you used during your previous jobs (studies, personal or professional projects) and how they were useful? 

    Answer -> I have used pandas, numpy, matplotilib, dash, and math. 

    - numpy and pandas : mostly used for data analysis, as it helps for framing data from external datasets (reading a csv file and then making an array out of it for example) 
    - matplotlib and dash : used for data visualisation, decently customisable layout. Exports to many formats for matplotlib, and possibility to make dynamic web apps for dash
    - math : computing mathematical functions

## A real estate developer has constructed a more than 100-storey building in the heart of Manhattan. Several months after the inauguration, residents complain about slow elevators, what can the real estate developer do to solve this problem?

    Answer -> The issue could lie on how the elevators where designed to work in the first place. If *all* elevators are catering to *every single* floor, some solutions could be : 
    - programm equal number of elevators catering to even and odd numbered floors (if 2 elevators : 1 catering to floors 1-99, 1 catering to floors 2-100)
    - progamm some elevators to only cater to the first 50 floors, others to cater to the last 50 (if 2 elevators : 1 catering to floors 1 to 50, 1 catering to floors -straight to- 51 and upwards)

## Is testing a waste of money? Why?

    Answer -> I have learned with these pytest challenges that testing is great to programm overall more robust and rigourous functions. The testing process helps detecting *where* the problem lies, in order for one to research *how * to fix it before making the test go green. Consequently, it cannot be a waste of money in my opinion : preventing bugs is always better than fixing them afterwards, therefore helping saving money. 

## Set up a challenge for another candidate in order to test his/her abilities, explain your choice.

    Answer -> [In Python] A new villain from an unknown galaxy has appeared on Earth and is causing chaos. The news has reached the Avengers who are due for a meeting at Tony Stark's place. To access it, each Avenger shall go throught the hand imprint recognition system designed by Jarvis, Tony Stark's AI system butler. 
    However, for some reason among the Avengers, Jarvis has developped a preference for Captain America, Black Panther, Black Widow and Captain Marvel. 
    Jarvis can obviously not refuse access to Tony. 

    You are Jarvis. Write a function that will not give access to any other Avenger. 

    For example : 

    Given '"Captain Marvel"', your function should return '"Welcome Captain Marvel, great to see you!"
    Given '"Tony Stark"', your function should return '"Do I really have a choice ? You can go."'
    Given '"Hulk"', your function should return '"Sorry I don't like you !"' 

    Explanation : I think this challenge will manage to test a candidate's ability to use the if-elif-else conditional statements.
